# Partner Synchronisation with Alma - Outlook Configuration
__[HOME](README.md)__

## Outlook Configuration
Fhe first step is to create an Outlook account if you do not already have one. It is also possible to use an Microsoft365 institution account, but this will require some work to be done by your IT team that manages the Microsoft365 __'Organisation'__ to configure an __'App__'. The Outlook account is required to receive Tepuna Status emails. You can simply go to https://outlook.live.com and create a new account.

You will also need to configure the account to support OAuth2 login access. The process for this is outlined here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/rest/get-started
